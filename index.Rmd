# **Introduction**

This website presents a collection of data-driven environmental and community analyses developed in collaboration with **Texas Trees Foundation** to support urban forestry, climate resilience, and public health initiatives across North Texas.

Texas Trees Foundation has a long-standing mission to create healthier communities through strategic tree planting, canopy expansion, and evidence-based environmental planning. The analyses presented here examine how trees, shade, and environmental conditions interact with temperature, air quality, and community-level outcomes.

Using longitudinal data, environmental sensors, and spatial analysis, this site provides accessible insights that support research, program evaluation, and data-informed decision-making for practitioners, policymakers, and community partners.



# **Project Areas**

* **SWMD (Southwestern Medical District)**  
  Environmental sensor-based analyses examining microclimate conditions, including temperature, wind, and shading effects across urban spaces.

* **Cool Schools**  
  Evaluations of heat mitigation and environmental conditions around school campuses to support safer, healthier learning environments.

* **Urban Forestry**  
  Analyses focused on tree canopy, urban forest conditions, and the role of trees in environmental and community outcomes.

* **Data Dictionary**  
  Detailed documentation of variables, sensors, and datasets used across analyses to support transparency and reproducibility.
