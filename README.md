# Texas Trees Foundation – Environmental & Urban Forestry Analysis

This repository contains environmental, spatial, and community-level analyses developed in collaboration with **Texas Trees Foundation** to support urban forestry, climate resilience, and public health initiatives.

The work presented here uses environmental sensor data, air quality measurements, and longitudinal datasets to examine how trees, shade, and urban form influence environmental conditions and community outcomes across North Texas.

## Project Purpose

Texas Trees Foundation has worked for decades to improve urban environments through tree planting, canopy expansion, and science-based planning. This repository supports that mission by providing data-driven insights into:

- Urban heat and microclimate conditions  
- Air quality patterns and temporal dynamics  
- The environmental benefits of trees and shade  
- Community-scale environmental exposure  

The analyses are intended to inform program design, evaluation, and policy-relevant decision-making.
